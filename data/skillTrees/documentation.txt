Freya Skill Trees created by Zoey76 (28/03/2011).

Structure example:
<list>
	<skillTree type="" classId="" parentClassId="">
		<skill name="" id="" level="" required-level="" sp="" auto-learn="" socialClass="" residenceSkill="" learnedByNpc="" learnedByFS="" />
		<skill name="" id="" level="" required-level="" sp="" auto-learn="" socialClass="" residenceSkill="" learnedByNpc="" learnedByFS="">
			<item id="" count="" />
			<preRequisiteSkill id="" lvl="" />
			<race>Human</race>
			<residenceId>1</residenceId>
			<subClassConditions slot="" lvl="" />
		</skill>
	</skillTree>
</list>

classId = CLASS ID
parentClassId = CLASS ID PARENT

type = SKILL TREE types like:
- classSkillTree = Skill learning for all professions.
- collectSkillTree
- fishingSkillTree
- gameMasterAuraSkillTree
- gameMasterSkillTree
- heroSkillTree
- nobleSkillTree
- pledgeSkillTree = Clan skill learning.
- subClassSkillTree
- subPledgeSkillTree
- transferSkillTree
- transformSkillTree

It's possible to create custom skill trees in different files and add those skills to the retail skill trees by using the proper type.
It's possible to add a skill(s) common to all classes by omitting the classId attribute.
