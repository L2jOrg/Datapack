<html><body>Santa Claus:<br>
Nice to meet you! I'm Santa Claus! Every year I come to give presents to all the good people of Elmoreaden. But this year some goblins stole all my presents and put them in enchanted squash seeds!<br>
Would you like to help me out? Use seeds with nectar to raise squashes and attack them with chrono weapons!<br>
I will trade you seeds for nectar. You can get nectar by killing any monsters all throughout the world.<br>

Plant the seed by double-clicking on it! Raise it well and claim your presents! Good luck!
