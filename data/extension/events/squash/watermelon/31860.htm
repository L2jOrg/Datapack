Nice to meet you! I'm Buzz the Cat, faithful employee to Gardener Fordson of Floran. My boss is one of the greatest agricultural geniuses in all of Aden. After such a successful summer, Gardener Fordson has reinvested in a new lot of improved magical squash seeds. He has decided to grow them for the Fall season. Fortunately for you, we still have more seeds than we know what to do with. We would love more nectar to develop full grown squashes to meet our increased customer demands.<br>
Would you like to help me out? <br> I will trade you seeds for nectar.  You can get nectar by killing any monsters near your level all throughout the world.<br>
