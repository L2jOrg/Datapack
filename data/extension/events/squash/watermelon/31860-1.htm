Squash grow up by taking in nectar. After planting a seed, drip nectar on it and it will grow quickly! <br1>
After taking enough nectar, the squash will evolve. If you hit it with a weapon, the squash will crack open!<br1>
Be careful, there are several things you should look out for.<br1>
<font color="LEVEL">First of all, if you hit it before it's fully grown,</font> it will wilt from lack of nutrition. <br1>
Also, since <font color="LEVEL">a squash tends to flee</font>, you should try to crack it open before it gets out of hand!  
Young squash that are not fully grown will run off in <font color="LEVEL">3 minutes</font> and fully grown squash will run away in <font color="LEVEL">a minute and 30 seconds</font>!  <br1>
<font color="LEVEL">Also, a large squash can't be opened with a regular weapon!  </font> I heard that there are <font color="LEVEL">chrono weapons</font> that produce musical sounds when you hit it against something.  
You will only be able to hit large squash with weapons of this type.  <br1>
<font color="LEVEL">One last thing!  Since it's not easy to open a large squash by yourself,</font> you should find a friend who can help you open it.<br1>
Do you understand everything I've told you?<br1>
Posible rewards you can get: <font color="LEVEL">Adena, Fireworks, Large Fireworks, Life Stones, Gems A and S grades, Crystals A and S grades, Giant Codex, Lunargent and Hellfire Oil, Blessed Scroll of Escape, Quick Healing Potions, Large Lucky Cubs, Ancient Enchant Scrolls A-grade, Vitality Ginseng or powerful herbs.</font><br><br>
