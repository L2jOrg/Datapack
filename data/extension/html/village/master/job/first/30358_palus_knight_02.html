In order to become a Palus Knight, you must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the Palus Knight test.<br>
Even after meeting these requirements, you still can't transfer to that class as long as you stay here. Permission to transfer class is given only to those who have visited the world beyond our realm.<br>
If you wish to transfer your class, therefore, you must travel south to the land of Gludio in Aden, the kingdom of Humans. We have established a secret guild there overseen by Grand Masters who will assign you tasks to prove your readiness. Carry out your duties well and you will be allowed to transfer your class.<br>
There are two towns in Gludio you may visit. The first is Gludin Village, which you can reach by following the road that leads towards the School of Dark Arts. The other is the Town of Gludio, which you can reach by taking a shortcut through the Neutral Zone. Although that will shorten your trip, watch out for any Elves you may encounter in the Neutral Zone!<br>
