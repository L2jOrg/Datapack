Anyone wishing to become an Elven Wizard must have achieved at least level 20 and passed the appropriate test. <font color="LEVEL">Rosella</font> of our village has been testing young Elves who aspire to become Wizards.<br>
Furthermore, no character may transfer classes who hasn't gained a broader understanding of the world by leaving the forest.<br>
Follow the road south of the Elven Forest across the Neutral Zone. When you reach the village where you need to cross a bridge, that's the Town of Gludio. Speak with <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Raymond</font> at the Temple there. He'll help you transfer class.<br>
