<html><body>Grand Master Bitz:<br>
To become a Rogue, your level must be at least 20, and you must pass the Test of the Rogue. But as I told you, you cannot become a Rogue here. You must first go out into the world and improve your skills.<br>
Therefore, you must go to <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font> to become a Rogue. To get to Gludin, there are two modes of transportation to choose from. If you wish to take the scenic route, then you'll want to purchase a boat ticket. Just go see old Firon down at the docks and he will set you up with passage. <font color="LEVEL">But if you are looking to go fast and free, simply talk to the gatekeeper.</font> In recent years it has been ordained that anyone level 40 and under can travel via the gatekeepers free of charge, as long as you haven't completed your 2nd class transfer yet. Great news, huh!?<br>
But if you really wish to travel by ship, you should leave the village through the south gate and follow the seashore to the southeast. When you get to the wharf, buy a boat ticket from Wharf Manager Firon. Once the boat docks, just get on. But take heed - if you don't have a ticket, you'll be kicked off the boat once it departs. The boat leaves every thirty minutes. There will be an announcement made before the ship leaves. Once in Gludin, <font color="LEVEL">find Grand Master Ramos</font>. You will find him at the Warrior's Guild. He will administer the Test of the Rogue to determine if you are worthy of this honor.<br>
