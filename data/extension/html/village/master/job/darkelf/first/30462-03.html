<font color="LEVEL">Palus Knights</font> are the elite knights of the Dark Elves. Their excellent swordsmanship is based on swift, precise attacks and effective defense, and it cannot be compared to other races that depend on mere strength or coarser skills.<br>
The most talented of Palus Knights are selected for the highest order, either as a<font color="LEVEL"> Shillien Knight</font> or a<font color="LEVEL"> Bladedancer</font>, with almost unearly skill in swordsmanship.<br>
To become a Palus Knight, you must pass the test and bring back the<font color="LEVEL"> gaze of the abyss</font> as proof.<br>
