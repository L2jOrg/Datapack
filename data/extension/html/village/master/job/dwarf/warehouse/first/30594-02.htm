The fundamental characteristics of <font color="LEVEL">Scavengers</font> and Artisans are that the Scavenger collects rare materials and the Artisan makes something valuable from those materials. Therefore, a Scavenger must have above average physical strength and combat abilities. He is a great hunter who will brave any danger to collect valuable materials.<br>
The most talented Scavengers are selected to be <font color="LEVEL">Bounty Hunters</font>. Bounty Hunters go to the extreme to find arcane items like dragon scales.<br>
