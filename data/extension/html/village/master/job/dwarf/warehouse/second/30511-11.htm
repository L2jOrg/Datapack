Congratulations! You have finally become a glorious Bounty Hunter. You probably know this already, but you can learn new skills from the Warehouse Keepers over there. Remember the saying "The most useless thing under the sun is a penniless Dwarf" and work diligently!<br>
Our guild has prepared this small gift to assist you in your journey. Take this to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you will be able to exchange it for a usable Shadow Weapon.
