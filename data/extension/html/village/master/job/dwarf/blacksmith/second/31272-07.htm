I am a Head Blacksmith who specializes in training exceptional Dwarven Warsmiths. Someone like you can learn nothing from me.<br>
But know this one thing, and know it well: You would never have been able to find the equipment that you now hold if it had not been for us Dwarven blacksmiths. That's how important we are.<br>
If you are a Scavenger, go find the Warehouse Chief. But leave me alone!
