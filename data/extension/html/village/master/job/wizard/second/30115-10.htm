A Warlock is an expert in the summoning arts. He hunts alone with the creature he has summoned. They may attack simultaneously or act as support for one another. Warlocks may summon as many different creatures as are needed for a party's situation.<br>
To become a Warlock your level must be over 40 and you must collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Summoner.<br>
