<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br>
You need the appropriate level and token to become an Oracle. To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become an Oracle, you must have the token that proves that you passed the Test of the Oracle.<br>
It seems you have passed the Test of the Oracle, but you cannot change profession because your level is lower than 20. If your level is lower than 20, you cannot change profession, even if you have a token. Please come back when you are ready.
