<font color="LEVEL">Elven Wizards</font> are mystics who can commune with spirits and use elemental magic, dark magic and summon magic at one level higher than Elven Mystics. They can issue commands to fire and wind at will and thereby attack the enemy, or kill them using the magic forces of darkness. They also summon spirits that  dwell in nature in the form of "servitors."<br>
Among Elven Wizards, those who wish to develop their elemental magic technique to a  higher level will follow the path of the <font color="LEVEL">Spellsinger</font>, while those who desire ultimate mastery of summoning magic will pursue the path of an <font color="LEVEL">Elemental Summoner</font>.<br>
In order to transfer to the Elven Wizard class, you must bring a proof called an <font color="LEVEL">Eternity Diamond</font>.<br>
