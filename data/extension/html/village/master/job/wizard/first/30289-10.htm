Elven Wizards are a mystical lot, all right! They commune more deeply with spirits, and use Elemental, Dark and Summon magic at a level superior even to that of the Elven Mystics. They actually command the forces of fire and wind at will! Their dark powers see them to victory more often than not! They also have the tendency to summon some very unpleasant Servitors if they've a mind to!<br>
Many Elven Wizards follow the path of the Spellsinger in order to develop their Elemental magic skills. Others choose to follow the path to the ultimate mastery of summoning, the Elemental Summoner!<br>
