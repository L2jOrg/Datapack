<font color="LEVEL">Elven Wizards</font> interact closely with spirits to create very powerful magic. They are known to use Elemental, Dark and Summoning Magic at a higher level than Elven Mystics. Elven Wizards are capable of launching devastating attacks of fire and wind upon their enemies, and possess a powerful dark magic capable of inflicting hideous death. They're also known to summon formidable monsters known as Servitors. <br><font color="LEVEL">Spellsingers</font> take Elemental Magic to its highest level among the Elven Wizards. Anyone wishing to master Summoning Magic should follow the path of the <font color="LEVEL">Elemental Summoner</font>.<br>
Anyone wishing to become an Elven Wizard must bring me an <font color="LEVEL">Eternity Diamond</font>. Once you've done this, I'll make you an Elven Wizard.<br>
