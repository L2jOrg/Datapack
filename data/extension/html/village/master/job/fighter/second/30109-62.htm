Congratulations! You are now a Hawkeye. Life as a Hawkeye may seem unfamiliar to you at first, but you can learn skills one by one from the masters nearby.<br>
Dedicate yourself to your new vocation, becoming a master of the bow whose arrows strike terror into our enemies.<br>
Our guild has prepared this small gift to assist you in your journey. Take this to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you will be able to exchange it for a usable Shadow Weapon.
