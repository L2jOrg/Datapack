Congratulations! You have now become a magnificent Plains Walker. Life as a Plains Walker may seem unfamiliar to you at first, but you can learn new skills from the masters nearby.<br>
I pray that you will become a great Plains Walker whose actions bring glory to the name of Eva, the goddess of water. Never forget your dignity and integrity as an Elf, and always remain steadfast in our faith. Congratulations once again!<br>
