The Hawkeye is a special occupation that is often called the "Bow Carrying Rogue." He has a natural battle style and is truly frightening during a siege, particularly if several Hawkeyes work together to eliminate enemies from long range.<br>
A Hawkeye possesses the ability to strengthen archery skills, the ability to shoot multiple shots in a row, and the ability to inflict damage in each arrow's area.<br>
In order to become a Hawkeye, you must be at least level 40, and you must obtain the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Trust and the Mark of Sagittarius.<br>
