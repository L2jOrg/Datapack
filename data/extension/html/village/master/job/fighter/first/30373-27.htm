<html><body>Grand Master Ramos:<br>
Congratulations! You have now become a magnificent Knight. Life as a Knight may still be unfamiliar, but do not be anxious. You can learn it one step at a time from the masters nearby.<br>
I pray that you will continue to grow in strength and honor, and that you will never neglect an opportunity to assist the weak and powerless. Congratulations once again!<br>
Our guild has prepared this small gift to assist you in your journey. Take this to <font color="LEVEL">the Grand Master, Grand Magister, Master Trainer or High Priest who permits transfers in any major town</font> and you will be able to exchange it for a Shadow Weapon.
