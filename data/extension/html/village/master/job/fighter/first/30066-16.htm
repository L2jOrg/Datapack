<font color="LEVEL">Elven Scouts</font> have protected our sacred forest for millennia. Their stealth and cunning allow them to destroy invaders and then silently melt back into the forest.<br>
The most elite Elven Scouts are chosen to be <font color="LEVEL">Plains Walkers</font>. Most become <font color="LEVEL">Silver Rangers</font> and acquire the ultimate mastery of archery. Talent is not enough, however! Endless practice is necessary to develop their skills.<br>
Those wishing to transfer to the Elven Scout class must pass the test administered by Master Reisa and obtain a recommendation letter from him.<br>
