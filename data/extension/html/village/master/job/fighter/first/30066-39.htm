<html><body>Grand Master Pabris:<br>
Congratulations! You have now become a magnificent Elven Scout. Life as an Elven Scout may be unfamiliar to you at first, but do not be anxious -- you can learn the skills you will need from the masters nearby.<br>
I pray that you will become a great Elven Scout whose deeds reflect glory on the name of Eva, the goddess of water. Never forget the dignity and integrity of the Elves, and remain steadfast in your vows until the end. Congratulations once again!<br>
