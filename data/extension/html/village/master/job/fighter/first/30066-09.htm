Of the three classes available for transfer, Rogues are certainly the most unique. They choose material gain over the agility of Warriors or the chivalry of Knights. Their stealth and aptitude for weapons and espionage make them essential in battle.<br>
The most elite Rogues are selected to be either <font color="LEVEL">Hawkeyes</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Treasure Hunters</font>. Their path is by no means an easy one.<br>
Anyone wishing to become a Rogue must have achieved at least level 20 and received a Letter of Recommendation from Captain Bezique.<br>
