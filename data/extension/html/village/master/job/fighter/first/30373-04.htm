The <font color="LEVEL">medallion of the Warrior</font> is a token given only to those that have passed the test to become a Warrior. To take the Test of the Warrior, look for <font color="LEVEL">Master Auron</font> in our guild, who has long been the chief Warrior of our society. He will let you take the Test of the Warrior.<br>
