<html><body> Select a clan member to receive the mantle of clan leader.<br>
Requests for authority transfer are usually processed every Wednesday morning. However, because the transfer process may complete sooner, consider your decision carefully before submitting a request.<br>
Once a request is processed, you cannot cancel the transfer. However, you can cancel at any time before processing.<br>
Since this process transfers all rights of the clan leader to another member, consider this action carefully before submitting a request.<br>
