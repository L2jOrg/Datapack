<html><body>Ingrit:<br>
The Death Eater is the most powerful and dangerous creature in this prison.<br1>
If you have the <font color="LEVEL">Key from the Central Part of the Western Wing of the Dungeon of Abyss</font>, You can get to the Death Eater.<br1>
However, remember: you will be alone with him. No one will come to your rescue. In addition, you will only have <font color="LEVEL">30 minutes</font> to destroy it.<br>
If you decide to retreat or fail and want to try your luck some other time, you will need a new key.<br>
And more: if <font color="LEVEL">the quantity and weight of items in your inventory will exceed 80%</font>, You can not get a reward, so take care of an empty seat before the battle begins.<br>
