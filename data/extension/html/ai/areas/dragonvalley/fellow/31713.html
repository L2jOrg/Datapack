We've received terrible news! It seems that <font color="LEVEL">Antharas</font> is awake! For now the dragon is sealed, but the seal will soon be broken, the beast will break free and burn Giran to the ground.<br>
Do you have courage to break into Antharas' Nest and prevent an upcoming disaster? Only the bravest warriors can stop the dragon!<br>
I can only teleport characters of <font color="LEVEL">level 70</font> and higher. <font color="LEVEL">an alliance leader must speak to me, and I will use the power of Antharas Watchman Theodric to teleport the alliance consisting of 27-300 members to Antharas' Lair.</font><br>
