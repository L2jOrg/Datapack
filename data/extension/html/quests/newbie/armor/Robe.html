You picked Moon Cape.<br><br>
You are getting stronger very quickly, so if you have reached <font color=LEVEL>level 20</font>, go to the village and start your <font color=LEVEL>class transfer</font>. You will get even stronger.<br>
I ve prepared a few things for you. Hope that the <font color=LEVEL>HP Potions</font>, and the <font color=LEVEL>Rice Cake of Flaming Fighting Spirit</font> are useful.
