I heard that Wolves and keltiers are wandering in front of the village. Those things get in the way of work. Especially when sending food to the mines, those Gnomes make some loud noises, so people hate it.<br>
I want to show them away. Can you help?<br>
If you help, I will talk to Gerald and get you some accessories.<br>
