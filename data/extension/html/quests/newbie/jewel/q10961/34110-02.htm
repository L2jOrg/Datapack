The southern part of the Jin Kamael village is called Hills of Hope. Its the place we first settled down, and we believed it would become our hope.<br>
A long time has passed, but you should also find your hope in that place.<br>
The Hills of Hope has relatively small animals that are not that dangerous. Start training by hunting them and get used to your senses.<br>
Hunt 20 <font color=LEVEL>Grey Keltir, Elder Grey Keltir, Black Wolf, Elder Black Wolf</font> and come back to me.<br>
