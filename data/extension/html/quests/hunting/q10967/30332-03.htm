The most fundamental thing is patience.<br1>
Achievements without effort often tend to be frothy.<br>
Time never flows by meaninglessly, and your effort always pays off in the end. Taking time to work slowly, but steadily without being impatient is the most basic yet also the most important thing.<br>
In that regard, the Abandoned Camp would be a good place to train this time. You should be more than capable of dealing with the Ol Mahums in that area.<br>
You can teleport to Abandoned Camp. It is on the hunting ground teleport list of Gludin Village, so it should be pretty straight forward.<br>
I wish you luck, then.
