<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br>
It used to be a peaceful and tranquil garden until a terrifying being appeared one day. It is said that the being turned every living thing there into stone before disappearing.<br>
Now only the likes of Harpies, Medusa, and Bugbears infest the garden.<br>
But there are rumors of late that ominous things are afoot once more, making everyone worry that this terrifying being may have reappeared. So I am looking for an adventurer who did be willing to go there and investigate.<br>
