Turning a greenhorn adventurer into a half-decent one has always been an important task.<br>
That is right, adventurers like you who haven't completed a class transfer yet. If you are skilled enough to transfer class, then there is no reason to delay it.<br>
I would not force you if you are adamant about not transferring your class, but getting it done will be much more beneficial to you. And its not particularly complex either, just look for the Transfer Class button and press it, and that's it.<br>
Alright, enough about the class transfer, here, why don't you get serious and start preparing to make a name for yourself as an adventurer?<br>
