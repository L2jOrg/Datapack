<html><body>High Priest Maximillian:<br>
The Death Pass is filled with death, as it is name implies. Death is always hunting because it is close to the Dragon Valley, where Antharas is located.<br>
There has been a slight change in Antharas lately, and some suspicious movements have been observed even in this area.<br>
I would be thankful if you could go to the Death Pass and find out what is going on.
