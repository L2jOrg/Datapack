<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br>
But now that he has another request to make, he felt it improper to keep going through someone else and wished to ask for your assistance in person.<br>
I am sure the High Priest Maximilian will tell you more about it.<br>
I know you must be tired and it is a long was to travel, so if you wish, I can send you to High Priest Maximilian.<br>
But of course, if you have other matters to attend to, you are welcome to do so and make your own way there afterward. After all, you just need to get to the Town of Giran and visit the Temple of Einhasad.<br>
